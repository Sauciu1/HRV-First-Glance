# HRV first glance investigation software.

[Investigation.ipynb](Investigation.ipynb)

I have been working on producing a notebook that could be quickly moved to a folder and used to throw a +/- quick glance into a dataset.

This is very much still a work in progress, but can be successfuly used to look into the Apnea dataset, a few examples of which are used as part of this file.

Please feel free to push changes.

I feel like having everything in a single notebook is becoming a bit clustered and will be working on refactoring the code.

Please keep in mind that this is still very much a work in progess and I will soon update it to something more useful.
